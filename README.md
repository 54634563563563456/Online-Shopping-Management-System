In the development of the Online Shopping Management System project,
I employed Apache NetBeans IDE and MySQL Workbench for data
storage. Utilizing Java in conjunction with the JFrame library, the
system's core functionalities were implemented. Structurally, the project
encompasses three essential modules: Administration, User, and
Supplier, each meticulously designed to fulfill distinct operational
requirements.
Collectively, this system facilitates streamlined oversight of users,
categories, products, suppliers, and transactions, fostering operational
efficiency. End-users are empowered to register accounts, procure items,
and maintain personal data, while suppliers can manage deliveries and
pertinent information. Administering comprehensive authority, the
administrator orchestrates seamless management across all system
facets, ensuring optimal functionality.
